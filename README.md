# Factorial-Calculation

This project implements the calculation of factorials of numbers using ConcurrentHashMap and Callable in Java. It demonstrates multithreaded programming and parallel calculations.

## Description

The program calculates the factorials of numbers from 1 to 5 in parallel threads. ExecutorService is used for thread management and Callable for asynchronous calculations.

## Usage

1. Compile the project:
   ```bash
    javac FactorialCalculator.java
    ```

3. Run the program:
    ```bash
    java FactorialCalculator
    ```

Requirements

- Java 8 or newer

Project structure

- FactorialCalculator.java: the main file with the implementation of factorial calculation.
